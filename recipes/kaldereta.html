    <h3>WHAT IS KALDERETA?</h3>

    <p>
        <em>Menudo</em> vs <em>Kaldereta</em> vs <em>Afritada</em>, the confusion comes from the similarities between
        the red stews, and how their traditional versions have evolved over time. They sort of blur together in a venn
        diagram of tomato-based meat stews served with potatoes and carrots, and it feels like you won't know which is
        which until you ask an experienced cook (AKA Your mom or your tita)

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Kaldereta</strong> often uses beef or pork ribs, and its main difference from the other red Filipino
        stews is the use of liver to add a rich, meaty depth to the sauce. Bay leaves and chili flakes
        add warmth and spice to the dish. Interestingly, while tomatoes are a staple in the modern kaldereta, they were
        actually optional in the traditional version.

    <h3>THE SECRET INGREDIENT: TIME</h3>

    <p>
        In the hands of an impatient cook, ribs can end up being dry and tough. Low and slow is the only way to go with
        this cut, as it’s the only way to achieve that tender, fall-off-the-bone texture. So why go through all that
        trouble when you could just use a more tender cut of meat?
    </p>
    <p>
        Using bone-in cuts like ribs keeps the connective tissues in the meat intact and prevents juices from leaking
        out while cooking, keeping more moisture in as it cooks. Perfect for braised dishes and stews like kaldereta.
        You’ll also get a lot of flavor from letting the bones simmer in that delicious sauce. Plus, they’re fairly
        inexpensive, so you don’t have to break the bank just to eat a delicious meat dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides, there’s something primal and satisfying about biting into tender, melt-in-your mouth meat and tearing
        it straight off the bone. Watching the glistening meat fall off the bone and gnawing on it after is a big part
        of what makes it so pleasurable to eat ribs.

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Sear beef</strong>: Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a large pan, pot, or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
                Working in
                batches, sear beef ribs until golden brown on all sides. Remove beef ribs and set aside. Reduce heat to
                medium. With the rendered fat, sauté the onion and garlic until fragrant and translucent. Add liver
                spread and chili flakes. Stir to combine.

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Let simmer</strong>: Crush tomatoes with your hands and add into the same pot. Then, add beef
                broth, and bay
                leaf. Add browned beef ribs back in. Increase the heat and bring to a boil. Once the liquid is boiling,
                reduce heat to low. Let simmer and continue to cook for 2 hours.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                <strong>Finish it up</strong>: Add potato and carrots. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until fork-tender. Add the green olives
                and bell peppers, then continue to cook for 5 more minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.
            </p>
