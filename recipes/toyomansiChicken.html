    <h2>WHAT IS TOYOMANSI CHICKEN?</h2>
    <p>
        Combine soy sauce and calamansi juice and you get <strong>toyomansi</strong>, a classic all-purpose Filipino
        sawsawan (dipping
        sauce). It comes as a partner to many dishes like <em>inihaw</em> (grilled meats), <em>bulalo</em>, siomai—just
        about anything
        that could welcome more salt and tang.
    </p>
    <p>
        This pan-seared chicken steak uses toyomansi as a marinade. Brown sugar rounds out the soy sauce and calamansi
        while helping the marinade caramelize into a glossy lacquer. With just a few simple ingredients, this dish
        becomes a no-brainer weekend meal—just make sure to let your chicken marinade an hour before cooking!

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Marinate chicken</strong>: Combine soy sauce, vinegar, onions, garlic, calamansi juice, and
                brown sugar in a
                mixing bowl or baking dish. (You can toss in the squeezed calamansi for extra flavor.) Stir to dissolve
                brown sugar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add chicken thigh fillets to the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator
                for 1–2 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Cook chicken</strong>: Heat 1 tbsp neutral oil in a pan over medium heat. Remove chicken from
                marinade (don’t
                discard it), letting any excess drip off before transferring to the pan skin side down. Cook until the
                chicken skin has darkened and crisped up a bit. Flip to cook the second side until browned.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Cook marinade</strong>: Add about ½ cup of marinade to the pan, or just enough to cover the
                bottom. Continue
                cooking, flipping chicken every now and then as the marinade thickens into a sauce, until chicken is
                fully cooked through.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Serve</strong>: Slice chicken thighs into strips. Transfer to individual serving plates or bowls with steamed
                rice, atchara, and calamansi
            </p>
        </li>
